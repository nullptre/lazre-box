# Example Terraform variable values for Lazre AWS deployment
#
# Copy this file to `terraform.tfvars` and edit the values before running:
#   terraform init
#   terraform apply

# -----------------------------
# bot_desired_count
# -----------------------------
# Number of bot tasks the ECS service should keep running.
# Recommended flow:
#   - First step: set to 0, so the bot does NOT start with empty configuration.
#   - Then you create necessary config files in EFS: upload .env and config files.
#   - Finally set bot_desired_count to 1 and run `terraform apply` again to start the bot.
#
# You can also temporarily scale the bot down later by setting this back to 0.
bot_desired_count = 0

# -----------------------------
# project_prefix
# -----------------------------
# Short identifier used as a prefix when naming AWS resources created by this
# Terraform configuration (ECS cluster, log groups, security groups, etc.).
# Change this if you want to run multiple independent Lazre deployments in
# the same AWS account (each with its own prefix).
project_prefix = "remont_pl_lazre"

# -----------------------------
# efs_root_directory
# -----------------------------
# Logical root directory on the EFS file system for this deployment.
# Inside the container, EFS is mounted at /var/lib/lazre, so the bot and
# indexer will see:
#   /var/lib/lazre/.env           -> stored at <EFS root><efs_root_directory>/.env
#   /var/lib/lazre/config/*.json  -> stored at <EFS root><efs_root_directory>/config
#
# If you add a second Lazre deployment in the future, give it a different
# efs_root_directory (for example, "/another_instance_data").
efs_root_directory = "/remont_pl_data"

# -----------------------------
# helper_ssh_key_name
# -----------------------------
# Name of an existing EC2 key pair in eu-central-1. Terraform will attach this
# key pair to the helper EC2 instance so that you can SSH into it from your
# laptop and manage the contents of the EFS file system (upload .env and
# config files, inspect data, etc.).
#
# Create this key pair in the AWS Console (EC2 -> Key pairs) before running
# `terraform apply`, download the .pem file, and set its name here.
helper_ssh_key_name = "remont-pl-helper-key"

# -----------------------------
# helper_ssh_cidr
# -----------------------------
# CIDR range allowed to SSH (port 22) into the helper EC2 instance.
# Use your current public IP with /32, for example:
#   "83.24.12.45/32"
#
# If your IP changes in the future, update this value and run `terraform apply`
# again so the security group rule is updated.
helper_ssh_cidr = "83.24.12.45/32"
